# Troubleshooting Methodology Facts

Good troubleshooting is a process that combines knowledge, experience, and
intuition. The following process has proven effective in a variety of
situations:

  1. Identify the symptoms and potential causes. Ask the user to describe the problem, check for error messages, and recreate the problem. Identify the affected area and determine how large the problem is. For example, fixes for one client workstation would likely be very different than fixes for an entire network segment. 
  2. Establish what has changed. Most often, problems are caused by new hardware or software or changes to the configuration. If necessary, ask questions to discover what might have changed that could have caused the problem. 
  3. Create a hypothesis. Review the list of potential causes and select the most probable cause. Look for common errors or solutions that can be tried quickly. 
  4. Create an action plan and account for side effects of the proposed plan. The plan might include purchases for hardware or equipment that need approval before proceeding. In addition, the plan might involve taking some services offline for a period of time. Identifying the effects ahead of time helps put measures into place to eliminate or reduce any potential negative consequences. 
  5. Implement the fix to the problem, and make sure that the solution has fully fixed the problem and has not caused any other problems. If necessary, implement additional steps to correct the problem if the first solution did not work. 
  6. Ensure user satisfaction. This may include educating the user, such as explaining what the problem was, the solution, and how to avoid this problem in the future.
  7. Document the solution and process. In the future, check the documentation to see what has changed or to help remember the solution to common problems. 

Remember, however, that troubleshooting is a process of both deduction and
induction. Experience will show when deviating from this process can save both
time and effort.
