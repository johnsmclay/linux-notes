# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard Facts

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) governs the unified file system for
Linux systems by defining a standard set of directories, subdirectories, and
files. FHS is a subset of the Linux Standards Base (LSB) which is an
organization and a set of guidelines for promoting a set of standards to
increase Linux distribution compatibility.
